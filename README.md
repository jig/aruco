This code sample prints a single JSON array to stdout with the coordinates of several Aruco markers that appear on the field of view of the camera.

Tested with:
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Raspberry Pi Camera HQ
- Raspberry Pi OS "Bookworm" 64 bit

Based on code from:
- [How to Detect ArUco Markers Using OpenCV and Python](https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-detect-aruco-markers-using-opencv-and-python/) by Automatic Addison
- [The Picamera2 Library; A libcamera-based Python library for Rasperry Pi cameras]()
